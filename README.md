Hey there! I'm Keerthana Kannan, a passionate MERN Stack developer who loves creating dynamic and interactive web applications. 

Simple Website Built with HTML & CSS

This is a basic website created using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills in front-end development, focusing on creating a clean, responsive layout and implementing modern design principles.

Key Features:

Fully responsive design for a seamless experience across devices.
Structured and well-commented HTML for easy readability.
Styled with CSS to ensure a polished and visually appealing look.
Simple, user-friendly interface.
This project serves as an introduction to my front-end development abilities, and I plan to continue building upon it as I explore more advanced features and functionality in web development.

Feel free to explore the project and check out the source code!
